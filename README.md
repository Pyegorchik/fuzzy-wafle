## The idea.

Once I have been falling asleep during watching how my favourite streamer again rolling random wheel and choosing what to watch. I thought for a moment "Can I do that? Can I as a programmer write down the same program?" My answer was "definetly not, I can't write smth like this." So, here we are and I am trying to replicate this website https://pointauc.ru/ 

# Disclaimer.
This is my first educational project. So, please, be patient and allow me to make mistakes instead of bulling ofr being rookie.
The whole program is written in Rust because I want to become Rust developer and I am learning how to use it. Yep, it's nor super efficient and productive to wtrite such app in Rust. However, it's fun!

# Plans:
1.Make random choosing

2.Make opportunity to add new slots

3.Make web version

4.Add anime

5.Sleep

6.Dota 2

7.Make wheel(?)

8.Add wheel to the website

9.Try to replicate other parts of https://pointauc.ru/ .


Sincerwely yours,
Pyegorchik.
